        <p>My favorite culture is the Spanish culture. I love how close and family-oriented the Spanish culture is. I also think they cook the most delicious food!</p>
        <p>One woman in history I can relate to is Lucille Ball. I love her sense of humor, and she was definitely a part of the women's equality movement. Another historical figure I relate to is Anne Frank. I am Jewish as well, so her story very much resonates with me. I find her truly courageous, and absolutely an important part of world history.</p>
        <p>A meal that represents me is strawberry french toast with whipped cream!
        <p>I feel most creative when I am on the beach or near the ocean!</p>
